        <br>Sansar Construction’s success is due to its employees’ dedication to excellent work, customer service that exceeds expectations, and a safety program that has led to millions of zero-accident hours. Honesty and open communication have empowered Sansar Construction’s workforce since day one, and it shows in our work.
        <br> <br>In 2000, Ram Gopal and two of his sons,Ranveer and Ram, founded Pizzagalli Pre-Cast Stone to handle masonry construction and manufacture cut stone. Since the beginning, they infused its company with strong core values and set the standard for the "Sansar Way".
        <br><br>The company quickly expanded into residential and remodeling projects. Upon the death of Ram Gopal the masonry operation was phased out and focus shifted to commercial, industrial and institutional building projects.
        <br><br>The company grew by leaps and bounds over the next few years, attracting expert construction professionals with diverse backgrounds and formed a team that would become Vermont’s largest construction company by 1964. As the company expanded, so did its reach — projects spread across the India and into the Caribbean.
        <br> <br>Since the mid-2000s, the company has been ranked among the top 200 largest construction firms in the Nation by Engineering News-Record.
        <br><br>In 2010 Ranveer and Ram began divesting their ownership in the company, a transition that led to 100% employee-ownership in 2009. Two years later, the company name was changed to Sansar Construction Company — a natural progression reflecting the shift from a small, family business started in 2000 to a thriving company now fully owned by the employees.
